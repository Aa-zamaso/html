 <p class="auto-style31"> Anime (Japanese: アニメ) is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan. Outside Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan. However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from a shortening of the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. Many works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are also produced outside Japan. Video games sometimes also feature themes and artstyles that can be considered as "Anime". </p>

 <p class="auto-style31"> The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917. A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (Manga), light novels, or video games. It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences. </p>

 <p class="auto-style31"> Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques. Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots. Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes. </p>

 <p class="auto-style31"> The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies, including major studios such as: 
 "<span class="auto-style36">Studio Ghibli, Kyoto Animation, Sunrise, Bones, Ufotable, MAPPA, Wit Studio, CoMix Wave Films, Production I.G, and Toei Animation</span>". Since the 1980s, the medium has also seen widespread international success with the rise of foreign dubbed, subtitled programming, and since the 2010s its increasing distribution through streaming services and a widening demographic embrace of anime culture, both within Japan and worldwide. As of 2016, Japanese animation accounted for 60% of the world's animated television shows. </p>

<br class="auto-style26"><span class="auto-style26">Now let's give you a full- or a complete-discription to Anime 
	</span> </div>

<p class="auto-style19"> 
<span class="auto-style28">Etymology:</span> <br class="auto-style26">

<span class="auto-style26">As a type of animation, anime is an art form that comprises many genres found in other mediums; it is sometimes mistakenly classified as a genre itself. In Japanese, the term anime is used to refer to all animated works, regardless of style or origin. English-language dictionaries typically define anime (/ˈænɪmeɪ/) as "a style of Japanese animation" or as "a style of animation originating in Japan". Other definitions are based on origin, making production in Japan a requisite for a work to be considered "anime".
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The etymology of the term anime is disputed. The English word "animation" is written in Japanese katakana as アニメーション (animēshon) and as アニメ (anime, pronounced [a.ɲi.me] ) in its shortened form. Some sources claim that the term is derived from the French term for animation dessin animé ("cartoon", literally 'animated drawing'), but others believe this to be a myth derived from the popularity of anime in France in the late 1970s and 1980s.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">In English, anime—when used as a common noun—normally functions as a mass noun. (For example: "</span><span class="auto-style2">Do you watch anime?</span><span class="auto-style26">" or "</span><span class="auto-style2">How much anime have you collected?</span><span class="auto-style26">") As with a few other Japanese words, such as saké and Pokémon, English texts sometimes spell anime as animé (as in French), with an acute accent over the final e, to cue the reader to pronounce the letter, not to leave it silent as English orthography may suggest. Prior to the widespread use of anime, the term Japanimation, a portmanteau of Japan and animation, was prevalent throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In the mid-1980s, the term anime began to supplant Japanimation; in general, the latter term now only appears in period works where it is used to distinguish and identify Japanese animation. 
</span> </p>

<p class="auto-style19"> 
<span class="auto-style28">History:</span>

<br class="auto-style26"> <br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style14">Precursors: </span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Emakimono and kagee are considered precursors of Japanese animation. Emakimono was common in the eleventh century. Traveling storytellers narrated legends and anecdotes while the emakimono was unrolled from the right to left in chronological order, as a moving panorama. Kagee was popular during the Edo period and originated from the shadows play of China. Magic lanterns from the Netherlands were also popular in the eighteenth century. The paper play called Kamishibai surged in the twelfth century and remained popular in the street theater until the 1930s. Puppets of the bunraku theater and ukiyo-e prints are considered ancestors of characters of most Japanese animations. Finally, mangas were a heavy inspiration for anime. Cartoonists Kitzawa Rakuten and Okamoto Ippei used film elements in their strips.

<br class="auto-style26"> <br class="auto-style26">
<p class="auto-style19"> <span class="auto-style14">Pioneers:
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Animation in Japan began in the early 20th century, when filmmakers started to experiment with techniques pioneered in France, Germany, the United States, and Russia. A claim for the earliest Japanese animation is Katsudō Shashin (c. 1907), a private work by an unknown creator. In 1917, the first professional and publicly displayed works began to appear; animators such as Ōten Shimokawa, Seitarō Kitayama, and Jun'ichi Kōuchi (considered the "fathers of anime") produced numerous films, the oldest surviving of which is Kōuchi's Namakura Gatana. Many early works were lost with the destruction of Shimokawa's warehouse in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">By the mid-1930s, animation was well-established in Japan as an alternative format to the live-action industry. It suffered competition from foreign producers, such as Disney, and many animators, including Noburō Ōfuji and Yasuji Murata, continued to work with cheaper cutout animation rather than cel animation. Other creators, including Kenzō Masaoka and Mitsuyo Seo, nevertheless made great strides in technique, benefiting from the patronage of the government, which employed animators to produce educational shorts and propaganda. In 1940, the government dissolved several artists' organizations to form the Shin Nippon Mangaka Kyōkai. The first talkie anime was Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka (1933), a short film produced by Masaoka. The first feature-length anime film was Momotaro: Sacred Sailors (1945), produced by Seo with a sponsorship from the Imperial Japanese Navy. The 1950s saw a proliferation of short, animated advertisements created for television. 
</span> </p>
<br class="auto-style26"> <br class="auto-style26">
<p class="auto-style19"> <span class="auto-style14">Modern era:</span><span class="auto-style26">
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">In the 1960s, manga artist and animator Osamu Tezuka adapted and simplified Disney animation techniques to reduce costs and limit frame counts in his productions. Originally intended as temporary measures to allow him to produce material on a tight schedule with an inexperienced staff, many of his limited animation practices came to define the medium's style. Three Tales (1960) was the first anime film broadcast on television; the first anime television series was Instant History (1961–64). An early and influential success was Astro Boy (1963–66), a television series directed by Tezuka based on his manga of the same name. Many animators at Tezuka's Mushi Production later established major anime studios (including Madhouse, Sunrise, and Pierrot).
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The 1970s saw growth in the popularity of manga, many of which were later animated. Tezuka's work—and that of other pioneers in the field—inspired characteristics and genres that remain fundamental elements of anime today. The giant robot genre (also known as "mecha"), for instance, took shape under Tezuka, developed into the super robot genre under Go Nagai and others, and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by Yoshiyuki Tomino, who developed the real robot genre. Robot anime series such as Gundam and Super Dimension Fortress Macross became instant classics in the 1980s, and the genre remained one of the most popular in the following decades. The bubble economy of the 1980s spurred a new era of high-budget and experimental anime films, including Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984), Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise (1987), and Akira (1988).
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995), a television series produced by Gainax and directed by Hideaki Anno, began another era of experimental anime titles, such as Ghost in the Shell (1995) and Cowboy Bebop (1998). In the 1990s, anime also began attracting greater interest in Western countries; major international successes include Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball Z, both of which were dubbed into more than a dozen languages worldwide. In 2003, Spirited Away, a Studio Ghibli feature film directed by Hayao Miyazaki, won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards. It later became the highest-grossing anime film, earning more than $355 million. Since the 2000s, an increased number of anime works have been adaptations of light novels and visual novels; successful examples include The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Fate/stay night (both 2006). Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train became the highest-grossing Japanese film and one of the world's highest-grossing films of 2020. It also became the fastest grossing film in Japanese cinema, because in 10 days it made 10 billion yen ($95.3m; £72m). It beat the previous record of Spirited Away which took 25 days.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">In 2021, the anime adaptations of Jujutsu Kaisen, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba and Tokyo Revengers were among the top 10 most discussed TV shows worldwide on Twitter. In 2022, Attack on Titan won the award of "Most In-Demand TV Series in the World 2021" in the Global TV Demand Awards. Attack on Titan became the first ever non-English language series to earn the title of World's Most In-Demand TV Show, previously held by only The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones.

<p class="auto-style19"> 
<span class="auto-style28">Attributes:</span><span class="auto-style26"> </span> </p>
<p class="auto-style19"> 
<br class="auto-style26">

<span class="auto-style26">Anime differs from other forms of animation by its art styles, methods of animation, its production, and its process. Visually, anime works exhibit a wide variety of art styles, differing between creators, artists, and studios. While no single art style predominates anime as a whole, they do share some similar attributes in terms of animation technique and character design.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Anime is fundamentally characterized by the use of limited animation, flat expression, the suspension of time, its thematic range, the presence of historical figures, its complex narrative line and, above all, a peculiar drawing style, with characters characterized by large and oval eyes, with very defined lines, bright colors and reduced movement of the lips. 
</span> </p>
<br class="auto-style26"> <br class="auto-style26">
<p class="auto-style19"><span class="auto-style14">Technique:
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Modern anime follows a typical animation production process, involving storyboarding, voice acting, character design, and cel production. Since the 1990s, animators have increasingly used computer animation to improve the efficiency of the production process. Early anime works were experimental, and consisted of images drawn on blackboards, stop motion animation of paper cutouts, and silhouette animation. Cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium. In the 21st century, the use of other animation techniques is mostly limited to independent short films, including the stop motion puppet animation work produced by Tadahito Mochinaga, Kihachirō Kawamoto and Tomoyasu Murata. Computers were integrated into the animation process in the 1990s, with works such as Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke mixing cel animation with computer-generated images. Fuji Film, a major cel production company, announced it would stop cel production, producing an industry panic to procure cel imports and hastening the switch to digital processes.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Prior to the digital era, anime was produced with traditional animation methods using a pose to pose approach. The majority of mainstream anime uses fewer expressive key frames and more in-between animation.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Japanese animation studios were pioneers of many limited animation techniques, and have given anime a distinct set of conventions. Unlike Disney animation, where the emphasis is on the movement, anime emphasizes the art quality and let limited animation techniques make up for the lack of time spent on movement. Such techniques are often used not only to meet deadlines but also as artistic devices. Anime scenes place emphasis on achieving three-dimensional views, and backgrounds are instrumental in creating the atmosphere of the work. The backgrounds are not always invented and are occasionally based on real locations, as exemplified in Howl's Moving Castle and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Oppliger stated that anime is one of the rare mediums where putting together an all-star cast usually comes out looking "tremendously impressive".
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The cinematic effects of anime differentiates itself from the stage plays found in American animation. Anime is cinematically shot as if by camera, including panning, zooming, distance and angle shots to more complex dynamic shots that would be difficult to produce in reality. In anime, the animation is produced before the voice acting, contrary to American animation which does the voice acting first.

<p class="auto-style19"><span class="auto-style14">Characters:
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The body proportions of human anime characters tend to accurately reflect the proportions of the human body in reality. The height of the head is considered by the artist as the base unit of proportion. Head heights can vary, but most anime characters are about seven to eight heads tall. Anime artists occasionally make deliberate modifications to body proportions to produce super deformed characters that feature a disproportionately small body compared to the head; many super deformed characters are two to four heads tall. Some anime works like Crayon Shin-chan completely disregard these proportions, in such a way that they resemble caricatured Western cartoons.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">A common anime character design convention is exaggerated eye size. The animation of characters with large eyes in anime can be traced back to Osamu Tezuka, who was deeply influenced by such early animation characters as Betty Boop, who was drawn with disproportionately large eyes. Tezuka is a central figure in anime and manga history, whose iconic art style and character designs allowed for the entire range of human emotions to be depicted solely through the eyes. The artist adds variable color shading to the eyes and particularly to the cornea to give them greater depth. Generally, a mixture of a light shade, the tone color, and a dark shade is used. Cultural anthropologist Rachel Thorn argues that Japanese animators and audiences do not perceive such stylized eyes as inherently more or less foreign. However, not all anime characters have large eyes. For example, the works of Hayao Miyazaki are known for having realistically proportioned eyes, as well as realistic hair colors on their characters.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Hair in anime is often unnaturally lively and colorful or uniquely styled. The movement of hair in anime is exaggerated and "hair actions" is used to emphasize the action and emotions of characters for added visual effect. Poitras traces hairstyle color to cover illustrations on manga, where eye-catching artwork and colorful tones are attractive for children's manga. Despite being produced for a domestic market, anime features characters whose race or nationality is not always defined, and this is often a deliberate decision, such as in the Pokémon animated series.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Anime and manga artists often draw from a common canon of iconic facial expression illustrations to denote particular moods and thoughts. These techniques are often different in form than their counterparts in Western animation, and they include a fixed iconography that is used as shorthand for certain emotions and moods. For example, a male character may develop a nosebleed when aroused. A variety of visual symbols are employed, including sweat drops to depict nervousness, visible blushing for embarrassment, or glowing eyes for an intense glare. Another recurring sight gag is the use of chibi (deformed, simplified character designs) figures to comedically punctuate emotions like confusion or embarrassment.

<p class="auto-style19"><span class="auto-style14">Music: </span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The opening and credits sequences of most anime television series are accompanied by J-pop or J-rock songs, often by reputed bands—as written with the series in mind—but are also aimed at the general music market, therefore they often allude only vaguely or not at all, to the thematic settings or plot of the series. Also, they are often used as incidental music ("insert songs") in an episode, in order to highlight particularly important scenes.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Future funk, a musical microgenre that evolved in the early 2010's from Vaporwave with a French house Euro disco influence, heavily uses anime visuals and samples along with Japanese City pop to build an aesthetic.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Since the 2020's anime songs have experienced a rapid growth in global online popularity due to their widened availability on music streaming services like Spotify and promotion by fans and artists on social media. In 2023, the opening theme Idol by YOASOBI of the anime series Oshi no Ko topped the Billboard Global 200 Excl. U.S. charts with 45.7 million streams and 24,000 copies sold outside the U.S. “Idol” has become the first Japanese song and anime song to top the Billboard Global chart as well as taking the first spot on the Apple Music's Top 100: Global chart.

<br class="auto-style26"> <br class="auto-style26">
<p class="auto-style19"><span class="auto-style14">Genres:</span><span class="auto-style26">
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Anime are often classified by target demographic, including children's (子供, kodomo), girls' (少女, shōjo), boys' (少年, shōnen), young men (青年, Seinen), young women (女性, josei) and a diverse range of genres targeting an adult audience. Shoujo and shounen anime sometimes contain elements popular with children of all genders in an attempt to gain crossover appeal. Adult anime may feature a slower pace or greater plot complexity that younger audiences may typically find unappealing, as well as adult themes and situations. A subset of adult anime works featuring pornographic elements are labeled "R18" in Japan, and are internationally known as hentai (originating from pervert (変態, hentai)). By contrast, some anime subgenres incorporate ecchi, offensive themes or undertones without depictions of sexual intercourse, as typified in the comedic or harem genres; due to its popularity among adolescent and adult anime enthusiasts, the inclusion of such elements is considered a form of fan service. Some genres explore homosexual romances, such as yaoi (male homosexuality) and yuri (female homosexuality). While often used in a pornographic context, the terms yaoi and yuri can also be used broadly in a wider context to describe or focus on the themes or the development of the relationships themselves.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Anime's genre classification differs from other types of animation and does not lend itself to simple classification. Gilles Poitras compared the labeling of Gundam 0080 and its complex depiction of war as a "giant robot" anime akin to simply labeling War and Peace a "war novel". Science fiction is a major anime genre and includes important historical works like Tezuka's Astro Boy and Yokoyama's Tetsujin 28-go. A major subgenre of science fiction is mecha, with the Gundam metaseries being iconic. The diverse fantasy genre includes works based on Asian and Western traditions and folklore; examples include the Japanese feudal fairytale InuYasha, and the depiction of Scandinavian goddesses who move to Japan to maintain a computer called Yggdrasil in Ah! My Goddess. Genre crossing in anime is also prevalent, such as the blend of fantasy and comedy in Dragon Half, and the incorporation of slapstick humor in the crime anime film Castle of Cagliostro. Other subgenres found in anime include magical girl, harem, sports, martial arts, literary adaptations, medievalism, and war.

<br class="auto-style26"> <br class="auto-style26">
<p class="auto-style19"><span class="auto-style14">Formats:
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Early anime works were made for theatrical viewing, and required played musical components before sound and vocal components were added to the production. In 1958, Nippon Television aired Mogura no Abanchūru ("Mole's Adventure"), both the first televised and first color anime to debut. It was not until the 1960s when the first televised series were broadcast and it has remained a popular medium since. Works released in a direct-to-video format are called "original video animation" (OVA) or "original animation video" (OAV); and are typically not released theatrically or televised prior to home media release.  The emergence of the Internet has led some animators to distribute works online in a format called "original net animation" (ONA). 
</span> 
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The home distribution of anime releases was popularized in the 1980s with the VHS and LaserDisc formats. The VHS NTSC video format used in both Japan and the United States is credited with aiding the rising popularity of anime in the 1990s. The LaserDisc and VHS formats were transcended by the DVD format which offered the unique advantages; including multiple subtitling and dubbing tracks on the same disc. The DVD format also has its drawbacks in its usage of region coding; adopted by the industry to solve licensing, piracy and export problems and restricted region indicated on the DVD player. The Video CD (VCD) format was popular in Hong Kong and Taiwan, but became only a minor format in the United States that was closely associated with bootleg copies.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">A key characteristic of many anime television shows is serialization, where a continuous story arc stretches over multiple episodes or seasons. Traditional American television had an episodic format, with each episode typically consisting of a self-contained story. In contrast, anime shows such as Dragon Ball Z had a serialization format, where continuous story arcs stretch over multiple episodes or seasons, which distinguished them from traditional American television shows; serialization has since also become a common characteristic of American streaming television shows during the "Peak TV" era.

<p class="auto-style24"> 
Industry: </p>
<p class="auto-style19"> 
<br class="auto-style26">


<span class="auto-style26">The animation industry consists of more than 430 production companies with some of the major studios including Toei Animation, Gainax, Madhouse, Gonzo, Sunrise, Bones, TMS Entertainment, Nippon Animation, P.A.Works, Studio Pierrot, Production I.G, Ufotable and Studio Ghibli. Many of the studios are organized into a trade association, The Association of Japanese Animations. There is also a labor union for workers in the industry, the Japanese Animation Creators Association. Studios will often work together to produce more complex and costly projects, as done with Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away. An anime episode can cost between US$100,000 and US$300,000 to produce. In 2001, animation accounted for 7% of the Japanese film market, above the 4.6% market share for live-action works. The popularity and success of anime is seen through the profitability of the DVD market, contributing nearly 70% of total sales. According to a 2016 article on Nikkei Asian Review, Japanese television stations have bought over ¥60 billion worth of anime from production companies "over the past few years", compared with under ¥20 billion from overseas. There has been a rise in sales of shows to television stations in Japan, caused by late night anime with adults as the target demographic. This type of anime is less popular outside Japan, being considered "more of a niche product". Spirited Away (2001) was the all-time highest-grossing film in Japan until overtaken by Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train in 2020. It was also the highest-grossing anime film worldwide until it was overtaken by Makoto Shinkai's 2016 film Your Name. Anime films represent a large part of the highest-grossing Japanese films yearly in Japan, with 6 out of the top 10 in 2014, in 2015 and also in 2016.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Anime has to be licensed by companies in other countries in order to be legally released. While anime has been licensed by its Japanese owners for use outside Japan since at least the 1960s, the practice became well-established in the United States in the late 1970s to early 1980s, when such TV series as Gatchaman and Captain Harlock were licensed from their Japanese parent companies for distribution in the US market. The trend towards American distribution of anime continued into the 1980s with the licensing of titles such as Voltron and the 'creation' of new series such as Robotech through the use of source material from several original series. 
</span> <br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">In the early 1990s, several companies began to experiment with the licensing of less children-oriented material. Some, such as A.D. Vision, and Central Park Media and its imprints, achieved fairly substantial commercial success and went on to become major players in the now very lucrative American anime market. Others, such as AnimEigo, achieved limited success. Many companies created directly by Japanese parent companies did not do as well, most releasing only one or two titles before completing their American operations.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Licenses are expensive, often hundreds of thousands of dollars for one series and tens of thousands for one movie. The prices vary widely; for example, Jinki: Extend cost only $91,000 to license while Kurau Phantom Memory cost $960,000. Simulcast Internet streaming rights can be cheaper, with prices around $1,000–2,000 an episode, but can also be more expensive, with some series costing more than US$200,000 per episode.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The anime market for the United States was worth approximately $2.74 billion in 2009. Dubbed animation began airing in the United States in 2000 on networks like The WB and Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. In 2005, this resulted in five of the top ten anime titles having previously aired on Cartoon Network. As a part of localization, some editing of cultural references may occur to better follow the references of the non-Japanese culture. The cost of English localization averages US$10,000 per episode.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The industry has been subject to both praise and condemnation for fansubs, the addition of unlicensed and unauthorized subtitled translations of anime series or films. Fansubs, which were originally distributed on VHS bootlegged cassettes in the 1980s, have been freely available and disseminated online since the 1990s. Since this practice raises concerns for copyright and piracy issues, fansubbers tend to adhere to an unwritten moral code to destroy or no longer distribute an anime once an official translated or subtitled version becomes licensed. They also try to encourage viewers to buy an official copy of the release once it comes out in English, although fansubs typically continue to circulate through file-sharing networks. Even so, the laid back regulations of the Japanese animation industry tend to overlook these issues, allowing it to grow underground and thus increasing its popularity until there is a demand for official high-quality releases for animation companies. This has led to an increase in global popularity of Japanese animations, reaching $40 million in sales in 2004.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Since the 2010s anime has become a global multibillion industry setting a sales record in 2017 of ¥2.15 trillion ($19.8 billion), driven largely by demand from overseas audiences. In 2019, Japan's anime industry was valued at $24 billion a year with 48% of that revenue coming from overseas (which is now its largest industry sector). By 2025 the anime industry is expected to reach a value of $30 billion with over 60% of that revenue coming from overseas.

<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) valued the domestic anime market in Japan at ¥2.4 trillion ($24 billion), including ¥2 trillion from licensed products, in 2005. JETRO reported sales of overseas anime exports in 2004 to be ¥2 trillion ($18 billion). JETRO valued the anime market in the United States at ¥520 billion ($5.2 billion), including $500 million in home video sales and over $4 billion from licensed products, in 2005. JETRO projected in 2005 that the worldwide anime market, including sales of licensed products, would grow to ¥10 trillion ($100 billion). The anime market in China was valued at $21 billion in 2017, and is projected to reach $31 billion by 2020. The global anime market size was valued at $26.055 billion in 2021 with 29% of the revenue coming from merchandise. It is expected that the global anime market will reach a value of $47.14 billion by 2028. By 2030 the global anime market is expected to reach a value of $48.3 Billion with the largest contributors to this growth being North America, Europe, China and The Middle East. In 2019, the annual overseas exports of Japanese animation exceeded $10 billion for the first time in history.

<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The anime industry has several annual awards that honor the year's best works. Major annual awards in Japan include the Ōfuji Noburō Award, the Mainichi Film Award for Best Animation Film, the Animation Kobe Awards, the Japan Media Arts Festival animation awards, the Seiyu Awards for voice actors, the Tokyo Anime Award and the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year. In the United States, anime films compete in the Crunchyroll Anime Awards. There were also the American Anime Awards, which were designed to recognize excellence in anime titles nominated by the industry, and were held only once in 2006. Anime productions have also been nominated and won awards not exclusively for anime, like the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature or the Golden Bear.

<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">In recent years, the anime industry has been accused by both Japanese and foreign media of underpaying and overworking its animators. In response the Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida promised to improve the working conditions and salary of all animators and creators working in the industry. A few anime studios such as MAPPA have taken actions to improve the working conditions of their employees. There has also been a slight increase in production costs and animator pays during the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 27, 2023, Nippon Anime Film Culture Association (NAFCA) was officially founded. The association aims to solve problems in the industry, including the improvement of conditions of the workers.

<br class="auto-style26">


<span class="auto-style26">Anime has become commercially profitable in Western countries, as demonstrated by early commercially successful Western adaptations of anime, such as Astro Boy and Speed Racer. Early American adaptions in the 1960s made Japan expand into the continental European market, first with productions aimed at European and Japanese children, such as Heidi, Vicky the Viking and Barbapapa, which aired in various countries. Italy, Spain, and France grew a particular interest in Japan's output, due to its cheap selling price and productive output. As of 2014, Italy imported the most anime outside Japan. Anime and manga were introduced to France in the late 1970s and became massively popular in spite of a moral panic led by French politicians in the 1980s and 1990s. These mass imports influenced anime popularity in South American, Arabic and German markets.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The beginning of 1980 saw the introduction of Japanese anime series into the American culture. In the 1990s, Japanese animation slowly gained popularity in America. Media companies such as Viz and Mixx began publishing and releasing animation into the American market. The 1988 film Akira is largely credited with popularizing anime in the Western world during the early 1990s, before anime was further popularized by television shows such as Pokémon and Dragon Ball Z in the late 1990s. By 1997, Japanese anime was the fastest-growing genre in the American video industry. The growth of the Internet later provided international audiences with an easy way to access Japanese content. Early on, online piracy played a major role in this, through over time many legal alternatives appeared. Since the 2010s various streaming services have become increasingly involved in the production and licensing of anime for the international markets. This is especially the case with net services such as Netflix and Crunchyroll which have large catalogs in Western countries, although as of 2020 anime fans in many developing non-Western countries, such as India and Philippines, have fewer options for obtaining access to legal content, and therefore still turn to online piracy. However beginning with the 2020s anime has been experiencing yet another boom in global popularity and demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic and streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max, Disney+, Hulu and anime-only services like Crunchyroll and Hidive, increasing the international availability of the amount of new licensed anime shows as well as the size of their catalogs. Netflix reported that, between October 2019 and September 2020, more than 100 million member households worldwide had watched at least one anime title on the platform. Anime titles appeared on the streaming platform's top-ten lists in almost 100 countries within the one-year period. As of 2021, anime series are the most demanded foreign-language television shows in the United States accounting for 30.5% of the market share. (In comparison, Spanish-language and Korean-language shows account for 21% and 11% of the market share, respectively.) In 2021 more than half of Netflix's global members watched anime. In 2022, the anime series Attack on Titan won the award of "Most In-Demand TV Series in the World 2021" in the Global TV Demand Awards. Attack on Titan became the first ever non-English language series to earn the title of "World's Most In-Demand TV Show", previously held by only The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Rising interest in anime as well as Japanese video games has led to an increase of university students in the United Kingdom wanting to get a degree in the Japanese language. The word anime alongside other Japanese pop cultural terms like shonen and shojo have been added to the Oxford English Dictionary.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Various anime and manga series have influenced Hollywood in the making of numerous famous movies and characters. Hollywood itself has produced live-action adaptations of various anime series such as Ghost in the Shell, Death Note, Dragon Ball Evolution and Cowboy Bebop. However most of these adaptations have been reviewed negatively by both the critics and the audience and have become box-office flops. The main reasons for the unsuccessfulness of Hollywood's adaptions of anime being the often change of plot and characters from the original source material and the limited capabilities a live-action movie or series can do in comparison to an animated counterpart. One particular exception however is Alita: Battle Angel, which has become a moderate commercial success, receiving generally positive reviews from both the critics and the audience for its visual effects and following the source material. The movie grossed $404 million worldwide, making it director Robert Rodriguez's highest-grossing film.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Anime and manga alongside many other parts of Japanese pop culture have helped Japan to gain a positive worldwide image and improve its relations with other countries. In 2015, during remarks welcoming Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to the White House, President Barack Obama thanked Japan for its cultural contributions to the United States by saying:
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">This visit is a celebration of the ties of friendship and family that bind our peoples. I first felt it when I was 6 years old when my mother took me to Japan. I felt it growing up in Hawaii, like communities across our country, home to so many proud Japanese Americans... Today is also a chance for Americans, especially our young people, to say thank you for all the things we love from Japan. Like karate and karaoke. Manga and anime. And, of course, emojis.

<span class="auto-style26">In July 2020, after the approval of a Chilean government project in which citizens of Chile would be allowed to withdraw up to 10% of their privately held retirement savings, journalist Pamela Jiles celebrated by running through Congress with her arms spread out behind her, imitating the move of many characters of the anime and manga series Naruto. In April 2021, Peruvian politicians Jorge Hugo Romero of the PPC and Milagros Juárez of the UPP cosplayed as anime characters to get the otaku vote.

<span class="auto-style26">In April 2023, the Japan Business Federation laid out a proposal aiming to spur the economic growth of Japan by further promoting the contents industry abroad, primarily anime, manga and video games, for measures to invite industry experts from abroad to come to Japan to work, and to link with the tourism sector to help foreign fans of manga and anime visit sites across the country associated with particular manga stories. The federation seeks on quadrupling the sales of Japanese content in overseas markets within the upcoming 10 years.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">A 2018 survey conducted in 20 countries and territories using a sample consisting of 6,600 respondents held by Dentsu revealed that 34% of all surveyed people found excellency in anime and manga more than other Japanese cultural or technological aspects which makes this mass Japanese media the 3rd most liked "Japanese thing", below Japanese cuisine (34.6%) and Japanese robotics (35.1%). The advertisement company views anime as a profitable tool for marketing campaigns in foreign countries due to its popularity and high reception. Anime plays a role in driving tourism to Japan. In surveys held by Statista between 2019 and 2020, 24.2% of tourists from the United States, 7.7% of tourists from China and 6.1% of tourists from South Korea said they were motivated to visit Japan because of Japanese popular culture. In a 2021 survey held by Crunchyroll market research, 94% of Gen-Z's and 73% of the general population said that they are familiar with anime.

<p class="auto-style19"><span class="auto-style14">Fan response:
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Anime clubs gave rise to anime conventions in the 1990s with the "anime boom", a period marked by anime's increased global popularity. These conventions are dedicated to anime and manga and include elements like cosplay contests and industry talk panels. Cosplay, a portmanteau of "costume play", is not unique to anime and has become popular in contests and masquerades at anime conventions. Japanese culture and words have entered English usage through the popularity of the medium, including otaku, an unflattering Japanese term commonly used in English to denote an obsessive fan of anime and/or manga. Another word that has arisen describing obsessive fans in the United States is wapanese meaning 'white individuals who want to be Japanese', or later known as weeaboo or weeb, individuals who demonstrate an obsession with Japanese anime subculture, a term that originated from abusive content posted on the website 4chan.org. While originally derogatory, the terms "Otaku" and "Weeb" have been reappropriated by the anime fandom overtime and today are used by some fans to refer to themselves in a comedic and more positive way. Anime enthusiasts have produced fan fiction and fan art, including computer wallpapers and anime music videos (AMVs).
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Many fans will visit sites depicted in anime, games, manga and other forms of otaku culture, this behavior is known as "Anime pilgrimage".
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">As of the 2020s, many anime fans and followers use social media platforms and other sites like YouTube, Twitch, Fandom, Facebook, Reddit, Discord, Tumblr, 4chan, Tiktok and Twitter with online communities and databases such as IMDb, MyAnimeList to discuss anime, manga and track their progress watching respective series as well as using news outlets such as Anime News Network.

<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Due to anime's increased popularity in recent years, a large number of celebrities such as Elon Musk, BTS and Ariana Grande have come out as anime fans.

<p class="auto-style19"><span class="auto-style14">Anime style:</span><span class="auto-style26">
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">One of the key points that made anime different from a handful of Western cartoons is the potential for visceral content. Once the expectation that the aspects of visual intrigue or animation are just for children is put aside, the audience can realize that themes involving violence, suffering, pain, and death can all be storytelling elements utilized in anime just as much as other media.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">However, as anime itself became increasingly popular, its styling has been inevitably the subject of both satire and serious creative productions. South Park's "Chinpokomon" and "Good Times with Weapons" episodes, Adult Swim's Perfect Hair Forever, and Nickelodeon's Kappa Mikey are examples of Western satirical depictions of Japanese culture and anime, but anime tropes have also been satirized by some anime such as KonoSuba.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Traditionally only Japanese works have been considered anime, but some works have sparked debate about blurring the lines between anime and cartoons, such as the American anime-style productions Avatar: The Last Airbender and Avatar: The Legend of Korra. These anime-styled works have become defined as anime-influenced animation, in an attempt to classify all anime styled works of non-Japanese origin. Some creators of these works cite anime as a source of inspiration, for example the French production team for Ōban Star-Racers that moved to Tokyo to collaborate with a Japanese production team. When anime is defined as a "style" rather than as a national product, it leaves open the possibility of anime being produced in other countries, but this has been contentious amongst fans, with John Oppliger stating, "The insistence on referring to original American art as Japanese "anime" or "manga" robs the work of its cultural identity."

<span class="auto-style26">A U.A.E.-Filipino produced TV series called Torkaizer is dubbed as the "Middle East's First Anime Show", and is currently in production and looking for funding. Netflix has produced multiple anime series in collaboration with Japanese animation studios, and in doing so, has offered a more accessible channel for distribution to Western markets.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The web-based series RWBY, produced by Texas-based company Rooster Teeth, is produced using an anime art style, and the series has been described as "anime" by multiple sources. For example, Adweek, in the headline to one of its articles, described the series as "American-made anime", and in another headline, The Huffington Post described it as simply "anime", without referencing its country of origin. In 2013, Monty Oum, the creator of RWBY, said "Some believe just like Scotch needs to be made in Scotland, an American company can't make anime. I think that's a narrow way of seeing it. Anime is an art form, and to say only one country can make this art is wrong." RWBY has been released in Japan with a Japanese language dub; the CEO of Rooster Teeth, Matt Hullum, commented "This is the first time any American-made anime has been marketed to Japan. It definitely usually works the other way around, and we're really pleased about that."

<span class="auto-style26">In Japanese culture and entertainment, media mix is a strategy to disperse content across multiple representations: different broadcast media, gaming technologies, cell phones, toys, amusement parks, and other methods. It is the Japanese term for a transmedia franchise. The term gained its circulation in late 1980s, but the origins of the strategy can be traced back to the 1960s with the proliferation of anime, with its interconnection of media and commodity goods.

<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The light novel series spans several virtual reality worlds, beginning with the game, Sword Art Online (SAO), which is set in a world known as Aincrad. Each world is built on a game engine called the World Seed, which was initially developed specifically for SAO by Akihiko Kayaba, but was later duplicated for Alfheim Online (ALO), and later willed to Kirito, who had it leaked online with the successful intention of reviving the virtual reality industry. A third world known as Gun Gale Online (GGO) appears in the third arc and is stylized as a first-person shooter game instead of a role-playing game, and is the main setting of Alternative Gun Gale Online. It was created using the World Seed by an American company. A fourth world appears in the fourth arc known as the Underworld (UW). The world itself was created using the World Seed as a base, but it is as realistic as the real world due to using many powerful government resources to keep it running.

<p class="auto-style19"> <span class="auto-style28">Plot: </span> 
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">See also: List of Sword Art Online characters
In 2022, a virtual reality massively multiplayer online role-playing game (VRMMORPG) called Sword Art Online (SAO) was released. With the NerveGear, a helmet that stimulates the user's five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds. Both the game and the NerveGear were created by Akihiko Kayaba. On November 6, 10,000 players log into SAO's mainframe cyberspace for the first time, only to discover that they are unable to log out. Kayaba appears and tells the players that they must beat all 100 floors of Aincrad, a steel castle which is the setting of SAO, if they wish to be free. He also states that those who suffer in-game deaths or forcibly remove the NerveGear out-of-game will suffer real-life deaths. 
</span> </p>

<p class="auto-style31">A player named Kazuto "Kirito" Kirigaya is one of 1,000 testers in the game's previous closed beta. With the advantage of previous VR gaming experience and a drive to protect other beta testers from discrimination, he isolates himself from the greater groups and plays the game alone, bearing the mantle of "beater", a portmanteau of "beta tester" and "cheater". As the players progress through the game Kirito eventually befriends a young woman named Asuna Yuuki, forming a relationship with and later marrying her in-game. After the duo discover the identity of Kayaba's secret ID, who was playing as "Heathcliff", the leader of the guild Asuna joined in, they confront and destroy him, freeing themselves and the other players from the game. </p>

<p class="auto-style31">In the real world, Kazuto discovers that 300 SAO players, including Asuna, remain trapped in their NerveGear. As he goes to the hospital to see Asuna, he meets Asuna's father Shouzou Yuuki who is asked by an associate of his, Nobuyuki Sugou, to make a decision, which Sugou later reveals to be his marriage with Asuna, angering Kazuto. Several months later, he is informed by Agil, another SAO survivor, that a figure similar to Asuna was spotted on "The World Tree" in another VRMMORPG cyberspace called Alfheim Online (ALO). Assisted in-game by his cousin and adoptive sister Suguha "Leafa" Kirigaya and Yui, a navigation pixie (originally an AI from SAO), he quickly learns that the trapped players in ALO are part of a plan conceived by Sugou to perform illegal experiments on their minds. The goal is to create the perfect mind-control for financial gain and to subjugate Asuna, whom he intends to marry in the real world, to assume control of her family's corporation. Kirito eventually stops the experiment and rescues the remaining 300 SAO players, foiling Sugou's plans. Before leaving ALO to see Asuna, Kayaba, who has uploaded his mind to the Internet using an experimental and destructively high-power version of NerveGear at the cost of his life, entrusts Kirito with The Seed – a package program designed to create virtual worlds. Kazuto eventually reunites with Asuna in the real world after thwarting an attack from Sugou and The Seed is released onto the Internet, reviving Aincrad as other VRMMORPGs begin to thrive. </p>

<p class="auto-style31">One year after the events of SAO, at the prompting of a government official investigating strange occurrences in VR, Kazuto takes on a job to investigate a series of murders involving another VRMMORPG called Gun Gale Online (GGO), the AmuSphere (the successor of the NerveGear), and a player called Death Gun. Aided by a female player named Shino "Sinon" Asada, he participates in a gunfight tournament called the Bullet of Bullets (BoB) and discovers the truth behind the murders, which originated with a player who participated in a player-killing guild in SAO. Through his and Sinon's efforts, two suspects are captured, though the third suspect, Johnny Black, escapes. </p>

<p class="auto-style31">Kazuto is later recruited to test an experimental FullDive machine, Soul Translator (STL), which has an interface far more realistic and complex than the previous machine he had played, to help RATH, a research and development organization under the Ministry of Defense (MOD), develop an artificial intelligence named A.L.I.C.E. He tests the STL by entering the Underworld (UW), a virtual reality cyberspace created with The Seed package. In the UW, the flow of time proceeds a thousand times faster than in the real world, and Kirito's memories of what happens inside are restricted. However, when Johnny Black ambushes and mortally wounds Kazuto with suxamethonium chloride, RATH recovers Kazuto and places him back into the STL to preserve his mind while attempts are made to save him. During his time in Underworld, Kirito befriends Eugeo, a carver in a small village of Rulid, and helps him on a journey to save Alice Zuberg, his friend who was taken by a group of highly skilled warriors known as the Integrity Knights for accidentally breaking a rule of the Axiom Church, the leaders of the Human Empire. He and Eugeo soon find themselves uncovering the secrets of the Axiom Church, led by a woman only known as "The Administrator", and the true purpose of Underworld itself, while unbeknownst to them, a war against the opposing Dark Territory is brewing on the horizon. They meet Alice, now an Integrity Knight, and though she does not remember them, Kirito helps her remember her true identity: a form of true artificial intelligence known as A.L.I.C.E. In the battle against the Administrator, Kirito manages to slay her, though Eugeo dies in the process, to Kirito's dismay. </p>

<p class="auto-style31">Meanwhile, in the real world, conflict escalates as American forces raid RATH's facility in the Ocean Turtle in an effort to take A.L.I.C.E. for purposes unknown. Two of the attackers - Gabriel "Vecta" Miller and Vassago "Prince of Hell" Cassals - take control of two Dark Territory characters as they unite the Dark Territory's inhabitants to aid them. With help from all his friends, Kirito manages to stop the attackers as well as foreign players lured by Vassago, and safely extract A.L.I.C.E. from UW, who gains a physical body - with Gabriel and Vassago being killed both virtually and physically in the process. However, Kirito does not log out in time before the flow of time is restored and spends 200 years in UW (about 2 weeks in the real world) with Asuna, who stayed behind for Kirito. After awakening they have their memories of 200 years in underworld removed under Kirito's request, though RATH employee Takeru Higa secretly keeps a backup consciousness of his 200 year self, who have unknown plans for the Underworld. </p>

<p class="auto-style31">One month later, Kirito, Asuna, and the others have their accounts forcibly migrated to Unital Ring, a new VRMMORPG which incorporates locations from all the other environments they previously visited, and investigate the cause while meeting some familiar faces. </p>

 </span> <span class="auto-style12">
 <br class="auto-style26"> </span> <br class="auto-style26">

 <br class="auto-style26"> <br class="auto-style26">
 
<span class="auto-style55">Jessica: Well, i will win! and iam sure (Laughs). One of the Anime properties is that they are imaginary - Unrealistic characters. Uh- and they also live in an imaginary world, which we call [Fantasy] sometimes. Also, their behaviour.
 </span>
 <br class="auto-style26"> <br class="auto-style26">

<span class="auto-style2">Zamaso: Oh Sadly, she has won! Well, let's go back to our discussion with our friend "Jessica". Ok, What is the most thing you like about Anime characters and what is the best gender you like most?</span><span class="auto-style55">
 </span>
 <br class="auto-style26"> <br class="auto-style26">

<span class="auto-style55">Jessica: Really, in Anime especially i love both gender but most i like is "girls" and this is not because iam girl. Nah, it's just because Anime girls (or sometimes in some movies it's called "Cat girls" (and they're called "Cat girls" because the have tails and cat ears so they're called "Cat girls")) <br> 
Also, even if the character design is a girl but not a "Cat girl" so the designer make it look more lovely and attractive.</span>
 <br class="auto-style26"> <br class="auto-style26">
 
<span class="auto-style2">Zamaso: Well, there is no argument between us in this point, because i love "Cat girls" too and i love both genders in Anime and in real life.</span><span class="auto-style55">
 </span>
 <br class="auto-style26"> <br class="auto-style26">

<span class="auto-style55">Jessica: I didn't say that i dont love "Boys" i mean that i love girls more than boys in Anime. But, in real life i really do love both genders!</span>
 <br class="auto-style26"> <br class="auto-style26">

<span class="auto-style2">Zamaso: Have i said that you 'Hate' boys. No. Anyway, it's not our point now. Well, Do you know how does Anime affect children?
 </span> 

<span class="auto-style55">
 <br> </span> <br class="auto-style26">

<span class="auto-style55">Jessica: Somewhat yeah! In which that children under 
</span>

<span class="auto-style10"> 
<span class="auto-style18">18</span><span class="auto-style12"> must not watch 
</span> <span class="auto-style18">18+</span><span class="auto-style12"> anime as we call it . Even though people younger than 18 must not watch 18+ anime because their mind is still small. And this is one of my suggestions, As they better watch it when they are older than 24 years old.
 </span></span>
 <br class="auto-style26"> <br class="auto-style26">

<span class="auto-style2">Zamaso: Well, i agree with you in this point. Well, how much anime have you watched up till now?</span><span class="auto-style55">
 </span>
 <br class="auto-style26"> <br class="auto-style26">

<span class="auto-style55">Jessica: Honestly, (Laughs) too many. or we can say it's about 3 serieses with all their episodes!

<span class="auto-style26">The third season of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, titled Swordsmith Village Arc, follows series protagonist Tanjiro Kamado and his sister, Nezuko, as they journey to a secret village in order to repair his sword following his battle against the Upper Rank demons Gyutaro and Daki. Upon arriving, Tanjiro finds himself once again ensnared in a battle with two more Upper Rank demons, fighting alongside the Mist Hashira Muichiro Tokito, the Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji, and his taciturn ally Genya Shinazugawa in order to protect the village’s inhabitants.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">To tell the truth, there’s much to dig into as far as the plotline of this season is concerned, both at the risk of spoiling one of the most touching moments of the series at the end of this season and for the fact that there’s not really much in the way of a plot to speak of. As far as the strengths of this season are concerned, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Swordsmith Village Arc is first and foremost a spectacular visual experience, packed with the sort of breathtaking sword fights and action sequences fans of the series have come to expect from anime studio Ufotable. As far as the season’s writing is concerned, the third season of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba offers little in the way of genuine twists or shocking revelations to chew on.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Even still, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Swordsmith Village Arc is a satisfactory installment in the long-running series, performing the unenviable task of bridging the divide between two of the most consequential arcs of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba and setting the stage for an exhilarating future going forward.

</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Yor, Loid, and Anya Forger sitting in the passenger car of a train overlooking a window in Spy x Family season 2.

Anya and the rest of the Forger family return as charming as ever in the second season of Spy x Family. The series follows a seemingly quaint family of three where each has a hidden secret. The father, Loid, is a government agent. Yor, the mother, is an assassin. Anya, the daughter, is a telepath. Together, the three navigate juggling home life and keeping their alternate lives hidden. (It’s like Hannah Montana but times three!)

The second season picks up after the events of the first, as Anya continues her work to become an imperial scholar and win an audience with political leader Donovan Desmond for her father’s secret mission to save the country. What I love about Spy x Family is how the most mundane moments can become top-secret missions filled with tension. A date might not just be an outing, but a dire situation where Yor must hide a gunshot wound, or a school assignment might turn into a grand adventure to find macaroons. Meanwhile, characters like Anya and her exaggerated facial expressions and goofball antics imbue the series with a kind of heart rare to series like this. It might seem trite, but it goes to show that forming a family might be the grandest adventure all along!

Pluto isn’t the first story about robots having feelings, but it’s one of the best to ever do it. A miracle of adaptation, Pluto takes the acclaimed manga by Naoki Urasawa — itself an adaptation of Osama Tezuka’s Astro Boy — and imbues it with dramatic heft, a murder mystery, and a biting Iraq War metaphor.

In telling a story about a mysterious serial killer out to destroy the world’s greatest robots and the human activists who advocate for their rights, Pluto contemplates humanity from the perspective of machines experiencing its extremes firsthand. Robots learn to love, hate, and grieve for the first time, and it’s almost too much to bear. How raw they are, compared to the humans they share the world with. Humans can simply forget. Maybe they shouldn’t.

</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">A Sukuna-possessed Yuji Itadori aiming an arrow made of fiery energy in Jujutsu Kaisen.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Following the success of its first season and the theatrical release of Jujutsu Kaisen 0, Jujutsu Kaisen came roaring back this summer for its second season. The next installment of the series consisted of two cours (i.e., broadcast seasons), with the first five episodes devoted to a nostalgic tale of youth and the tragic falling-out between Gojo Satoru and his best friend, Suguru Geto, while the second cour jumps back to the present to thrust its cast into an absolutely feral string of fights during the Shibuya Incident Arc. Together, it makes for what has been my favorite season of the show so far.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Although the first cour still contains its fair share of action, the show allows us to see Gojo interact with friends and evokes a sense of levity that came in his younger years. This story, in turn, contrasts with the absolute ferocity of the conditions portrayed in the rest of the season. In it, Yuiji Itadori and his peers from Jujutsu High and the larger sorcery world must stave off an impending plot from a cabal of monsters known as cursed spirits. Maniacal, feral, and utterly devastating, the fights shared between characters show studio Mappa going full-flex. This season pulses with emotional intensity and high stakes. It’s excellent and — as fans have pointed out — gets pretty horny at points, so give it a watch if hot anime men are your vibe.

</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">A blond-haired boy (Maru), a brown-haired boy, and a brown-haired girl (Kiruko) stare at a fish creature with multiple arms through the window of a ship in Tengoku Daimakyo (Heavenly Delusion).
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">While watching Production I.G’s Tengoku Daimakyo, the new sci-fi mystery anime based on Masakazu Ishiguro’s manga series (which is known as Heavenly Delusion in English), I couldn’t help but think of Katsuhiro Otomo and his 1988 magnum opus, Akira. Both center on a generation of children who, brought up in the wake of an apocalyptic disaster, must fend for themselves in a world that has all but given up on the future while finding their own purpose in life. Tengoku Daimakyo does enough to distinguish itself from Otomo’s work by focusing on a relationship between two characters that touches deeply on the themes of friendship, gender, and adolescence.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Set 15 years after the fall of civilization, Tengoku Daimakyo alternates between two stories: that of Maru and Kiruko, two children who journey through the ruins of Tokyo in search of a mysterious place referred to only as “Heaven,” and that of a group of schoolchildren with strange powers living in a high-tech underground research facility, one of whom bears a striking resemblance to Maru. While searching for Heaven, Maru and Kiruko are attacked by vicious otherworldly creatures that only Maru seems to possess the ability to destroy. How are these two stories connected? What is the origin of Maru’s strange power, and how are these strange creatures related to the end of the world? Half of the fun of watching Tengoku Daimakyo is figuring that out! The other half is immediately rewatching the series to catch all of the clues hiding in plain sight you missed watching it the first time.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">With a memorable cast of interesting characters, beautiful animation, an engrossing post-apocalyptic mystery plot with twists that are as profound as they are personal, and a terrific score, Tengoku Daimakyo is one of the must-watch anime of 2023.

<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The XVX-016 Gundam Aerial reaching its right hand forward and glowing with purple and pink highlights in Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch From Mercury.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Simply put, Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury is a show that has everything. Put aside the storied and intimidatingly complex franchise it’s a part of for a moment — Witch From Mercury does an astounding job of standing on its own two feet, with plenty to offer if you’ve never seen a Gundam and never will again. (I hope you do, though.) Equal parts romance, comedy of manners, sci-fi mech brawler, political thriller, and slice-of-life boarding school drama, The Witch from Mercury succeeds by wearing all of its influences on its sleeve in a mashup that’s thrilling for both the fact that every episode has something new in store and also for the care it takes in developing its entire cast.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The Witch from Mercury starts out full of Gossip Girl-type snobs in a military school and slowly makes them all confront the reality they’ve been sheltered from, forcing them to consider the cost of the games they play and bringing the socioeconomic strife they benefit from to their doorstep. Through its protagonist, the naive, sweet, and gifted pilot Suletta Mercury, the series deftly explores cycles of abuse and oppression, with an interest in how power protects itself, and what it takes to disrupt that power. And yes, it’s also a killer Gundam show, one that constantly has homages to and remixes what came before in a way that’ll please new fans as it hooks a new generation of them.

</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">A blonde-haired anime boy (Sosuke), A black-haired anime girl with pigtails and glasses (Makoto), and a brown-haired anime girl (Mitsumi) stare forward at their picture being taken in Skip and Loafer.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The best part of Skip and Loafer is that the romantic lead is just an incredibly nice guy. Yeah, he’s cool and popular and handsome — but he’s also just a good dude!
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The show follows Mitsumi Iwakura, an ambitious girl who moves from her small town to attend a prestigious high school in Tokyo. Though she’s a hardworking overachiever, she’s a little unprepared for the hustle and bustle of city life — and attending a school where the class size is more than six people. Confused by public transit on her first day, she runs into Sōsuke Shima, a very go-with-the-flow sort of dude, who is also running late. He’s remarkably more calm about it, and takes her under his wing.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The two spark up an unlikely friendship: Shima quickly becomes the hearthrob that all the girls have crushes on, while Mitsumi’s spunky go-getter attitude and unfamiliarity with social norms often lands her in awkward situations. But Shima is just big-hearted and patient, and he clearly likes to spend time with Mitsumi. It’s not a one-sided relationship, however. Mitsumi’s passion and dedication rekindle something in Shima, whose mysterious past is only beginning to be revealed in the show.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The rest of the cast bolsters the show (especially Mitsumi’s cool stylist aunt, Nao), but they never eclipse the main characters and their connection. Their friendship is the foundation of not just any romantic relationship that must blossom, but their own individual character growth and also the show itself. It’s just thoroughly charming to watch these two very different people connect and build a friendship (and possibly a romance?).

<span class="auto-style26">A yellow-haired anime man (Vash the Stampede) in a red coat with orange circular glasses smiling and staring off into the distance.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">There’s a lot of history to Trigun Stampede, but the moment it starts — with a spectacular disaster in the stars that comes crashing down to a bleak desert under an impossibly blue sky — that doesn’t really matter.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Studio Orange’s reimagining of Trigun, the seminal ’90s manga and anime, stands on its own two feet with tremendous confidence and more than enough swagger. It’s an immediately compelling introduction (or reintroduction) to Vash the Stampede, a legendary hurricane of trouble with an enormous bounty on his head. None of that makes sense, though. For one, he’s kind of a doofus? And for another, he’s an incredible gunslinger who just refuses to kill people. The more time the viewer spends with him, the less he makes sense — because he should have succumbed to despair by now. Everyone should have.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Trigun Stampede is an apocalypse that is desperate but not despairing, a wasteland of broken people figuring out how to persevere and find things worth fighting for after the world is already broken and there isn’t any fixing it. Its blundering protagonist hides enormous tragedy, and its dazzling action rewards repeat viewings on the biggest screen you can play it on. It’s not just one of the best anime of the year — it’s simply one of the best shows.

</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">From the writer behind Kaguya-sama: Love is War, Aka Akasaka, comes Oshi no Ko, another brilliant series, though in a different way. While Kaguya-sama is good at making you cringe, laugh, and cheer for the young lovers, Oshi no Ko is pretty good at making your stomach churn from the coverage of real topics that plague the entertainment industry. Every episode of Oshi no Ko introduces a new twist, paired alongside stunning animation by studio Doga Kobo.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">It’s really hard to describe the premise of Oshi no Ko without spoiling any of the twists, but it starts with a young promising idol named Ai Hoshino moving to the countryside due to an unplanned pregnancy. Her doctor, who is a fan of Ai, is mysteriously killed and reincarnated as one of her twin children. The other twin is reincarnated from one of the doctor’s former patients – who is also a huge Ai fan. While not knowing who the other is, they’re trying to figure out what’s going on while navigating the entertainment industry.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">It sounds weird, I know. But if you love mystery and drama, you will need to give Oshi no Ko a watch. It’s a series where you just have to finish the first 80-minute(!) episode to really understand the hype and it’s best watched while knowing very little beforehand.

</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">I knew that Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End had already won my heart and earned its place as one of my favorite anime of the year during its first handful of episodes. Based on Kanehito Yamada and Tsukasa Abe’s fantasy manga, the anime follows the story of Frieren, an elven mage who, along with a group of fellow adventurers, slayed a maniacal demon king and saved the world. After journeying together for over a decade, the group parts ways, with Frieren venturing off on her own in pursuit of deepening her knowledge of magic. As months turn into years and years turn into decades, Frieren witnesses the world change around her as her friends die of old age and pass into the annals of legend. With a new understanding of the nature of mortality, Frieren embarks on a personal journey of self-discovery for a new calling in life.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">Directed by Keiichirō Saitō (Bocchi the Rock!), Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End is a stunningly beautiful meditation on life rife with action and humor aplenty. It’s an intensely character-focused fantasy adventure that eschews expectations of grandiosity in favor of poignant and heart-wrenching episodes of Frieren’s life as she learns to more deliberately nurture and deepen her relationships and her appreciation for the world. For all those reasons and more, it’s an anime worth seeking out and making the time for.

<span class="auto-style26">If Wotakoi: Love Is Hard for Otaku is the perfect nerd adult romance anime, My Love Story with Yamada-kun at Lv999 is like its little sister that isn’t quite there, but still pretty good. Akane Kinoshita meets pro gamer Akito Yamada in an MMORPG after going through a tough breakup. After using the MMO as a coping mechanism, she slowly starts to develop feelings for Yamada.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The series is an extremely traditional shoujo series: Akane is clumsy and naive, Yamada is stoic and seemingly unfeeling, there’s side characters rooting for our two protagonists, romantic rivals appear — it’s what you’d expect from a typical romance series for young women. The accuracy of the MMORPG struggles is what makes it extra charming, but it’s an all-around cute watch, especially if you love shoujo anime.

</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">2017’s Nier: Automata is one of the best video games of the last 10 years, a meditative and genre-defying action game that demanded players directly confront, in a way that only video games can, the all-consuming existential dread that one can face when tallying up the many dooms humanity faces here in the early 21st century. Strange, frustrating, baffling, and tremendously moving, Automata is such an argument for video games as a medium that adapting it for television seems almost like a violation of the game’s whole deal.
</span>

<span class="auto-style26">In its first episode, Ver. 1.1a almost confirms these fears, with a straight adaptation of the game’s opening moments that does little to sell why it’s special to the uninitiated, or justify the investment by the already converted. Then it pivots on its heel to suggest that the series might ultimately be doing something else entirely. This is part of the fun: There’s no way of knowing for sure until the end.
</span>
<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">For now, the base appeal is the same as what drew unsuspecting players to director Yoko Taro’s game in the first place: a strange sci-fi far future where warrior androids fight an endless war on behalf of humans that have abandoned the Earth. Taking over the planet in humanity’s absence are crude machines, who war mindlessly against the androids in a perpetual stalemate. This is how it goes, until some of the machines suddenly lose interest in war and begin to grow flowers, and some androids begin to question their mission and purpose.

<br class="auto-style26">
<span class="auto-style26">The mysteries of Ver. 1.1a and how different it may ultimately end up being from its source material have unspooled slowly since the show’s Jan. 7 premiere, after production delays resulted in a roughly 1-month hiatus between episodes 3 and 4. It’s a ride worth getting on, though — few creators leave it all on the floor the way Yoko Taro does.

<dd class="auto-style19"> <span class="auto-style26">AGGRETSUKO SEASON 5↴
haida’s overbearing father, a large hyena in a robe, stares down angrily at haida and retsuko, who both look up fearfully in Aggretsuko season 5.

This year brought us the fifth and final season of the Netflix original anime based on the Sanrio mascot Aggretsuko. Although the series started as a workplace rom-com about an anthropomorphized red panda named Retsuko, the showrunners have since led its protagonist to surprising places. In her ongoing journey into adulthood, Retsuko has done everything from being the girlfriend of the heartthrob CEO of a tech company to becoming an idol and a pop star.

The fifth season continues the series tradition of sending the young office worker to unexpected places by showing her run for public office. Although the series has a somewhat whimsical nature to it, it still continues to express a surprising tenderness that is sure to strike a soft spot in any 20- or 30-something who is trying to figure out how to balance family, love, life, and work with all their messiness and complications. Because of this, Aggretsuko’s final season is a very easy recommendation for seasoned animation fans and general viewers alike.
